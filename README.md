# beastio

This package primarily provides a library of functions for reading
    and post-processing BEAST and BEAST2 output files (both log and trees 
    files), calculating statistics statistics on the output and plotting the 
    results. The package also contains some functions that are useful for 
    creating the input XML files, although it does not provide an interface
    for creating full BEAST or BEAST2 XML input files.
